# object tree walking
- Live code vs static source code- Some members of objects only appear after code is run
- Some members are noise (e.g. all the `__str__` things)

# Retrofitting scope onto a scopeless language
- Is the `_underscore` public or private?
- Is stuff not in `__all__` public or private?
- Is the audience someone who wants to maintain the code (must understand it all)
  or use the public interface

# HTML generation
- Templating strategy (python strings or mako or jinja)
- Customizable templates

# Customization points

# Markup language
- ad hoc (pydoc)
- Well known (rst, md, google-style guidelines)

# API first or hand writ
