"""Generate Python documentation in HTML or text for interactive use.

At the Python interactive prompt, calling help(thing) on a Python object
documents the object, and calling help() starts up an interactive
help session.

Or, at the shell command line outside of Python:

Run "pydoc <name>" to show documentation on something.  <name> may be
the name of a function, module, package, or a dotted reference to a
class or function within a module or module in a package.  If the
argument contains a path segment delimiter (e.g. slash on Unix,
backslash on Windows) it is treated as the path to a Python source file.

Run "pydoc -k <keyword>" to search for a keyword in the synopsis lines
of all available modules.

Run "pydoc -n <hostname>" to start an HTTP server with the given
hostname (default: localhost) on the local machine.

Run "pydoc -p <port>" to start an HTTP server on the given port on the
local machine.  Port number 0 can be used to get an arbitrary unused port.

Run "pydoc -b" to start an HTTP server on an arbitrary unused port and
open a web browser to interactively browse documentation.  Combine with
the -n and -p options to control the hostname and port used.

Run "pydoc -w <name>" to write out the HTML documentation for a module
to a file named "<name>.html".

Module docs for core modules are assumed to be in

    https://docs.python.org/X.Y/library/

This can be overridden by setting the PYTHONDOCS environment variable
to a different URL or to a local directory containing the Library
Reference Manual pages.

# Known bugs that can't be fixed here:
#   - synopsis() cannot be prevented from clobbering existing
#     loaded modules.
#   - If the __file__ attribute on a module is a relative path and
#     the current directory is changed with os.chdir(), an incorrect
#     path will be displayed.
